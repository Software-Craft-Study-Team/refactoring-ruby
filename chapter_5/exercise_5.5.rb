# Exercise 5.5: Triggers
# Consider the smells described in this chapter.
# A. Which of these do you find most often? Which do you create most often?
# B. To stop children from sucking their thumbs, some parents put a bad-tasting or
# spicy solution on the child’s thumb. This serves as a trigger that reminds the child
# not to do that. What triggers can you give yourself to help you recognize when
# you’re just beginning to create one of these smells?
